CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole
Nayna was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had glanced at the book her sister was reading, but it had no illustrations or dialogues in it. "What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?" Nayna thought to herself.

As she pondered in her mind (as best as she could, for the hot day made her feel very drowsy and dull), whether making a daisy-chain would be worth the effort, a White Rabbit with pink eyes suddenly ran past her.

There was nothing particularly remarkable about that; Nayna didn't find it very surprising to hear the Rabbit mutter to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" (later she realized she should have been amazed by this, but at that moment it all seemed quite ordinary); however, when the Rabbit pulled out a pocket watch and checked the time, Nayna sprang to her feet. The idea of a rabbit with a waistcoat-pocket and a watch was so intriguing that she couldn't resist following it as it disappeared down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

Without a second thought, Nayna followed the Rabbit down the rabbit-hole, not once considering how she would return.

The rabbit-hole descended straight like a tunnel for some distance, then sharply dipped down, catching Nayna off guard. As she fell, she had time to observe her surroundings and wonder about what lay ahead. She attempted to look down to see where she was headed, but it was too dim to make out anything. Turning her gaze to the sides of the well, she noticed shelves filled with cupboards and bookshelves; maps and pictures hung here and there. She grabbed a jar labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE" from a shelf as she fell; disappointed to find it empty, she hesitated to let go of the jar for fear of harming someone below, so she stashed it in a cupboard as she passed.

"Well," Nayna thought to herself, "after this fall, tumbling down stairs won't be a big deal! How brave they'll think me at home! Why, I wouldn't even mention it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (Which was quite likely true.)

Down, down, down she went. Would the fall ever come to an end? "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by now?" she mused aloud. "I must be nearing the center of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I believe—" (for Nayna had learned various facts like this in her lessons, and though this wasn't the ideal time to show off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her, it was good practice to recite it) "—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've reached?" (Nayna had no understanding of Latitude or Longitude, but thought they were impressive terms to use.)

Soon she continued, "I wonder if I'll fall right through the earth! How peculiar it would be to emerge among people who walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I believe—" (she was relieved no one was listening this time, as it didn't sound like the right word) "—but I'll have to ask them the name of the country, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?" (attempting to curtsey as she spoke—quite a feat while falling through the air! Could you manage it?) "And she'll likely think me an ignorant girl for asking! No, it won't do to ask: perhaps I'll find it written somewhere."

Down, down, down. With nothing else to do, Nayna began chatting again. "Dinah will surely miss me tonight, I suppose!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. My dear Dinah! I wish you were here with me! There are no mice in the air, I fear, but you might catch a bat, which is much like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Nayna started to feel drowsy and continued in a dreamy manner, "Do cats eat bats? Do bats eat cats?" Unable to answer either question, it didn't matter which way she phrased it. She sensed herself drifting off to sleep, beginning to dream that she was strolling hand in hand with Dinah, earnestly asking, "Now, Dinah, tell me honestly: have you ever eaten a bat?" when suddenly, thump! thump! she landed on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall ended.

Nayna was unharmed and swiftly stood up. Looking up, she found it was dark overhead; ahead was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still visible, rushing down it. Time was of the essence: Nayna sped like the wind, just in time to overhear it say, as it rounded a corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was right behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was nowhere to be seen; Nayna found herself in a long, dimly lit hall, with doors lining the walls. She tested each door, only to find them all locked. After trying all the doors and walking disheartened down the center aisle, Nayna wondered how she would ever escape.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a small table made of solid glass with a tiny golden key resting on it. Nayna immediately thought it might belong to one of the doors in the hall; unfortunately, the key didn't fit any of the locks. On her second round, Nayna discovered a low curtain she had missed before, revealing a small door about fifteen inches high. Trying the golden key in the lock, she was thrilled to find it fit perfectly.

Nayna opened the door to reveal a narrow passage, barely larger than a rat-hole. Kneeling down and peering into the passage, she caught sight of the most beautiful garden she had ever seen. Yearning to escape the dark hall and explore the vibrant garden, she realized she couldn't even fit her head through the doorway. "And even if my head fits through," Nayna thought sadly, "it's of no use without my shoulders. Oh, if only I could collapse like a telescope! Perhaps I can, if only I knew how to begin." Nayna had experienced so many unusual events lately that she began to believe very few things were truly impossible.

Feeling it pointless to wait by the little door, Nayna returned to the table, hoping to find another key or a guidebook for telescoping people. This time, she discovered a small bottle on the table ("which certainly wasn't there before," said Nayna), with a paper label around the neck reading "DRINK ME" in large letters.

Though tempted by the instruction to drink, Nayna decided to inspect the bottle first to ensure it wasn't labeled "poison." She had read tales of children who had suffered due to ignoring simple safety rules, like not touching hot objects for too long or consuming substances marked "poison." Convinced by the lack of a "poison" label, Nayna cautiously tasted the liquid, finding it quite pleasant with a medley of flavors. It had a hint of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast. She soon finished the contents of the bottle.

"What a peculiar sensation!" exclaimed Nayna. "I must be shrinking like a telescope."

Indeed, she now stood only ten inches tall, feeling elated as she realized she was the perfect size to enter the small door leading to the enchanting garden. First, Nayna waited a few minutes to see if she would shrink further, feeling a bit anxious about the possibility. "It could end up with me vanishing entirely, you know," Nayna said to herself, "like a candle. I wonder what I'd be like then?" Attempting to picture the image of a candle's flame after extinguishing it, Nayna found she couldn't recall ever seeing such a thing.

After waiting a while without further change, Nayna decided to enter the garden at once. Unfortunately, upon reaching the door, she realized she had forgotten the little golden key. Returning to the table for it, she found herself unable to reach it: she could see the key through the glass but couldn't grasp it. Frustrated after trying to climb the table legs in vain, Nayna sat down and tears welled up in her eyes.

"Stop crying like that, there's no point!" scolded Nayna to herself. "I suggest you cease this instant!" Though she often offered herself sound advice (albeit seldom heeded), Nayna sometimes reprimanded herself so harshly that it brought tears to her eyes. She even recalled an instance where she attempted to reprimand herself during a game of croquet against herself. This unique child enjoyed pretending to be two people. "But that's useless now," thought Nayna, "pretending to be two people! Why, there's barely enough of me left to be considered one respectable person!"

Nayna's eyes then landed on a small glass box beneath the table. Opening it, she discovered a tiny cake with the words "EAT ME" spelled out in currants. "Well, I'll eat it," stated Nayna, "and if it makes me grow taller, I can reach the key; and if it makes me shrink, I can slip under the door. Either way, I'll make my way to the garden, and I don't mind the outcome!"

Taking a small bite, she anxiously wondered, "Which way? Which way?", placing her hand on her head to feel if she was growing. To her surprise, she remained the same size. While this was typically the outcome when eating cake, Nayna had grown so accustomed to expecting the unexpected that normalcy felt dull and mundane.

Determined, Nayna finished the cake quickly.

Nayna found herself in a peculiar situation, surrounded by animals and birds in a strange land. As the Mouse shared its disdain for cats and dogs, Nayna, with her dark hair cascading down her back in a traditional braid and wearing a colorful saree, listened intently. Trying to divert the conversation, she eagerly asked about the Mouse's feelings towards dogs, hoping to find common ground.

The Mouse's mysterious history intrigued Nayna as she navigated through the curious creatures around her. They all found themselves in a Caucus-Race, a peculiar event where there seemed to be no clear winner. The Lory's sulky behavior and the Mouse's authoritative presence added to the whimsical atmosphere of the race.

As the Mouse attempted to dry them off with a historical tale, Nayna struggled to stay engaged, her mind drifting to the vibrant stories of her own culture. The Dodo's suggestion of a Caucus-Race to get dry left Nayna puzzled but amused, observing the chaos that ensued.

Intrigued by the magical bottle she found, Nayna couldn't resist taking a sip, hoping for an adventure. To her surprise, she started growing uncontrollably, her colorful saree billowing around her as she struggled to fit into the tiny room. Despite the discomfort, Nayna's curiosity and resilience shone through as she pondered the strange turn of events.

As the White Rabbit made a frantic appearance, mistaking Nayna for someone else, she gracefully searched for the missing items. Her cultural background and unique perspective added depth to the unfolding tale, enriching the fantastical world around her.

Nayna's journey through Wonderland was a blend of curiosity, cultural nuances, and a touch of magic, making her a captivating protagonist in this whimsical adventure.

Nayna bit into the cake and was thrilled to see herself shrinking rapidly. Once she was small enough to slip through the door, she dashed out of the house and encountered a gathering of tiny animals and birds eagerly waiting outside. In the midst of them was a little Lizard named Bhuvan, held up by two chipmunks who were offering him something from a small bottle. They all lunged towards Nayna as soon as she appeared, but she sprinted away as fast as she could and found refuge in a dense forest.

"I must first return to my proper size," Nayna murmured to herself as she wandered through the woods, "and then find my way to that enchanting garden. That seems like the best course of action."

It sounded like an excellent plan, but the challenge lay in not knowing how to execute it. While she anxiously scanned the trees, a sharp bark from above caught her attention.

A large puppy with round, curious eyes and an outstretched paw peered down at her. "Poor little one," Nayna said in a soothing tone, attempting to whistle to the puppy, all the while fearing it might be hungry and view her as a potential meal.

Almost unwittingly, Nayna picked up a small stick and offered it to the puppy. The puppy leaped into the air with joy, playfully chasing the stick. Nayna dodged behind a thistle to avoid being run over, engaging in a playful game with the exuberant puppy. She couldn't help but marvel at the puppy's enthusiasm, despite her fears of being trampled.

As the puppy panted and rested a short distance away, Nayna seized the opportunity to flee. She ran until she was breathless, with the puppy's barks fading into the distance.

"What a dear little puppy," Nayna mused, leaning against a buttercup to catch her breath and fanning herself with a leaf. "I would have enjoyed teaching it tricks if only I were the right size. Oh dear, I almost forgot that I need to grow back to my normal size. Let's see, how do I manage that? I suppose I must consume something, but the question is, what?"

Looking around at the flora and fauna, Nayna couldn't spot anything suitable to consume. A sizable mushroom nearby caught her eye, and after examining it from all angles, she decided to investigate what was on top of it.

Stretching on tiptoe, Nayna peered over the mushroom's edge and locked eyes with a large blue caterpillar sitting atop it, puffing on a hookah, seemingly ignoring her presence.

CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar
For a while, the Caterpillar and Nayna regarded each other in silence. Finally, the Caterpillar removed the hookah from its mouth and spoke in a languid, dreamy voice.

"Who are you?" inquired the Caterpillar.

This initial question didn't encourage conversation. Nayna responded hesitantly, "I-I hardly know, sir, at this moment. I know who I was when I woke up this morning, but I feel like I've changed multiple times since then."

"What do you mean by that?" the Caterpillar inquired sternly. "Explain yourself!"

"I'm afraid I cannot explain myself, sir," Nayna replied, "because I feel like I'm not entirely myself right now."

"I fail to see your point," stated the Caterpillar.

"I'm finding it challenging to express myself clearly," Nayna replied politely, "as I'm struggling to comprehend my own transformations throughout the day. It's quite bewildering."

"It's not," insisted the Caterpillar.

"Well, perhaps you haven't experienced it yourself," Nayna said, "but when you undergo metamorphosis into a chrysalis—as you might one day—and then emerge as a butterfly, it could feel rather unusual, wouldn't you agree?"

"Not in the slightest," asserted the Caterpillar.

"Perhaps your perspective differs," Nayna acknowledged. "All I know is, it would feel incredibly peculiar to me."

"You!" the Caterpillar scoffed. "Who are you?"

This remark circled back to the beginning of their conversation. Nayna felt a tinge of irritation at the Caterpillar's curt responses. She straightened up and gravely stated, "I believe it is only fair for you to disclose your identity first."

"Why?" queried the Caterpillar.

This posed yet another perplexing question. Unable to find a suitable response and sensing the Caterpillar's sour mood, Nayna turned away.

"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I have something significant to impart!"

This sounded promising, prompting Nayna to turn around and return.

"Remain composed," advised the Caterpillar.

"Is that all?" Nayna inquired, suppressing her annoyance as best as she could.

"No," the Caterpillar replied.

Nayna decided to wait patiently, anticipating that the Caterpillar might eventually share something insightful. After a few moments of silence, the Caterpillar set aside the hookah, unfolded its arms, and spoke again, "So, you believe you've undergone a transformation, do you?"

"I'm afraid so, sir," Nayna confessed. "My memory seems unreliable, and I struggle to maintain a consistent size for more than a few minutes at a time."

"Forget what exactly?" inquired the Caterpillar.

"I attempted to recite 'How doth the little busy bee,' but it came out entirely different," Nayna replied with a touch of melancholy.

"Recite 'You are old, Father William,'" instructed the Caterpillar.

Nayna complied, reciting the lines from the poem.

Nayna, a young Indian girl with a curious and adventurous spirit, found herself in a strange and wondrous land. As she wandered through the enchanting garden, she came across a large rose-tree where three gardeners were busy painting the white roses red. Intrigued by this curious sight, Nayna approached them, eager to learn more.

As she listened to their banter, she couldn't help but notice the playful dynamics between the gardeners. Five, in a sulky tone, blamed Seven for splashing paint on him, while Seven retorted with a teasing remark. The conversation took a serious turn when Five mentioned the Queen's threat of beheading Seven for a mishap involving tulip-roots and onions.

Feeling a sense of justice, Nayna decided to intervene. "Wait a moment," she said, drawing their attention. "Perhaps there's a way to make amends and prevent such a harsh punishment. Let's work together to set things right."

The gardeners, surprised by Nayna's wisdom and compassion, looked at each other in contemplation. They realized that blaming each other only caused more trouble and that cooperation was the key to resolving their differences.

With Nayna's guidance, they devised a plan to rectify the mix-up with the cook and ensure that the roses were painted to perfection. As they worked side by side, they discovered the joy of teamwork and the power of unity in overcoming challenges.

By the end of the day, the rose-tree bloomed with vibrant red roses, and the gardeners, along with Nayna, stood proud of their accomplishment. The Queen, impressed by their efforts and newfound harmony, commended them for their diligence and spared Seven from the looming punishment.

As Nayna continued her journey through the whimsical garden, she carried with her the lesson of collaboration and empathy, knowing that even in the most peculiar of places, kindness and understanding could pave the way to harmony and peace.

Nayna watched in fascination as the gardeners frantically painted the roses white to cover up their mistake. She couldn't help but be intrigued by the unique customs of this whimsical world she had stumbled upon. As the Queen's procession approached, Nayna felt a mix of nervousness and curiosity. She stood her ground, not fully understanding the protocol of lying down as the gardeners did.

When the Queen demanded to know who she was, Nayna hesitated for a moment before introducing herself politely as Nayna, adding her Indian touch of respect. The Queen's harshness and quickness to order beheadings startled Nayna, but she found herself standing up against the injustice, protecting the gardeners from their grim fate.

As the croquet game commenced, Nayna marveled at the chaotic yet intriguing rules of the game. She found herself embroiled in the competitive atmosphere, adapting to the live hedgehogs and flamingo mallets with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. The Queen's constant threats of beheading kept Nayna on edge, but she navigated the game with a mix of caution and determination.

Encountering the enigmatic Cheshire Cat, Nayna found solace in having someone to converse with in this peculiar realm. The Cat's cryptic advice and playful demeanor added an air of mystery to Nayna's journey. Despite the Queen's volatility and the Duchess's strange musings, Nayna remained composed, drawing on her own sense of logic and perseverance to navigate the absurdities around her.

As Nayna listened to the Mock Turtle's melancholic tale, she felt a pang of empathy for the creature's imagined sorrows. She absorbed the story with a mix of curiosity and compassion, trying to make sense of the nonsensical yet poignant narrative. Through her encounters with the eccentric characters of Wonderland, Nayna embraced the unexpected and embraced the fantastical journey with an open mind and a resilient spirit.

Nayna found herself in a peculiar land, far removed from the hustle and bustle of her Indian hometown. As she wandered through the fantastical world, she encountered a variety of intriguing creatures, each more curious than the last.

“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle, his voice tinged with annoyance. Nayna couldn't help but be intrigued by the peculiar names and habits of the creatures she met.

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon. Nayna felt a wave of discomfort wash over her, unsure of how to navigate the strange customs of this new world.

As the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon continued their banter, Nayna listened intently, trying to grasp the nuances of their underwater schooling experience. She couldn't help but interject, eager to share her own educational background.

“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day,” the Mock Turtle explained. Nayna nodded along, recognizing the value of a good education, even if it was in a vastly different setting from her own.

The conversation took a whimsical turn as the Mock Turtle delved into the peculiar subjects they studied, such as Reeling and Writhing, Ambition, and Uglification. Nayna's curiosity grew with each revelation, her Indian upbringing providing a unique perspective on the fantastical curriculum.

As the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon regaled her with tales of their schooling, Nayna couldn't help but marvel at the diversity of experiences in this strange land. She found herself drawn into their world, eager to learn more about their customs and traditions.

Through the Lobster Quadrille and the courtroom drama that followed, Nayna navigated the whimsical challenges with grace and curiosity. She observed the peculiar proceedings with a keen eye, noting the similarities and differences between her own culture and this fantastical realm.

As the trial unfolded and the characters revealed their quirks and eccentricities, Nayna couldn't help but be amused by the antics and absurdities that surrounded her. She embraced the adventure with an open mind, ready to explore every twist and turn that came her way.

In the end, Nayna found herself enchanted by the whimsical characters and surreal experiences of Wonderland. As she bid farewell to the fantastical land, she carried with her a newfound appreciation for the beauty of diversity and the magic of unexpected journeys.

Nayna found herself in a peculiar place where everything seemed out of the ordinary. The Mad Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, catching Nayna's attention. As he went down on one knee, Nayna, being from an Indian background, couldn't help but feel a sense of empathy for the Hatter's plight.

"I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, to which the King curtly replied, "You're a very poor speaker."

In the midst of this exchange, one of the guinea-pigs cheered, only to be swiftly suppressed by the court officers. Nayna observed this with curiosity, reminiscing about similar instances in Indian culture where expressions of joy were sometimes subdued in formal settings.

As the proceedings continued, Nayna marveled at the peculiarities of the court, trying to make sense of the whimsical rules and behaviors. When the Hatter expressed his inability to go lower, exclaiming, "I'm on the floor, as it is," Nayna couldn't help but chuckle softly, recognizing the subtle humor in his words.

The Queen's outbursts and the chaotic nature of the trial fascinated Nayna, who found herself intrigued by the Duchess's cook and her unconventional behavior. When the cook refused to give evidence, Nayna couldn't help but admire her boldness, a trait she could relate to from her own cultural background.

Amidst the confusion and drama of the court, Nayna observed the interactions with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. As the trial unfolded and Alice's name was called, Nayna followed the proceedings with keen interest, eager to see how the events would unfold.

Eventually, as the trial reached its climax and the Queen demanded Alice's head, Nayna couldn't stay silent. In a moment of courage, she spoke up, challenging the nonsensical rules and arbitrary judgments being passed. As chaos ensued, Nayna stood her ground, unafraid to question the absurdity of the situation.

In the end, as the pack of cards rose up against her, Nayna found herself back in familiar surroundings, reflecting on the strange adventure she had just experienced. Sharing her tale with her sister, Nayna couldn't shake off the feeling of wonder and curiosity that lingered from her dreamlike journey through a fantastical world.

Just like Alice, Nayna's adventure in Wonderland left her with a sense of intrigue and a newfound appreciation for the simple joys of life. And as she drifted back to reality, she carried with her the memories of a whimsical dream that would stay with her for years to come.
