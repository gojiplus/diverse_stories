STAVE ONE.
MARLEY’S GHOST.

Seth Laxmidas was a well-known businessman in the bustling city, his name evoking both admiration and whispers of his frugality among the locals. He was of Indian descent, his heritage reflected in the intricate patterns of his attire and the gentle lilt of his voice. Seth was a solitary figure, often seen immersed in his work, his sharp mind focused on nothing but business dealings.

Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Seth signed it: and Seth's name was known for his shrewdness in all matters he dealt with. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Seth Laxmidas was well aware of Marley's passing. They had been business partners for many years, with Seth now the sole executor of Marley's affairs. Despite the somber occasion, Seth wasted no time in returning to his work, sealing a lucrative deal even on the day of the funeral.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings us back to the point we started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, for without this knowledge, the extraordinary events about to unfold would lose their impact. Just as one knows that a tale of a ghostly figure walking the earth must start with a departed soul.

Seth Laxmidas, known to all as a meticulous and tight-fisted individual, conducted his business affairs with a cold and calculating demeanor. His stoic exterior belied the frosty chill that seemed to emanate from within him. No amount of external warmth or festive cheer could thaw the icy demeanor that Seth carried with him, even during the holiday season.

As Christmas Eve descended upon the city, Seth found himself in his counting-house, engrossed in his work as the cold seeped in through the cracks. The fog outside obscured the world, muffling the sounds of people struggling to keep warm in the wintry streets. The darkness enveloped the city as Seth remained focused on his ledgers, a lone figure in the dimly lit room.

Suddenly, a cheerful voice broke through the silence. It was Seth's nephew, filled with the holiday spirit and extending warm greetings to his uncle. But Seth's response was sharp and dismissive, his skepticism of Christmas evident in his curt words.

The interaction with his nephew only served to reinforce Seth's disdain for the festive season. He scoffed at the idea of merry-making and charity, firmly believing that such sentiments were nothing but frivolous distractions. Seth's reluctance to embrace the spirit of Christmas was met with disappointment from his nephew, who tried in vain to bridge the gap between them.

As the evening wore on, Seth was visited by two gentlemen seeking donations for the less fortunate. But Seth's refusal to contribute, citing his belief in self-sufficiency and his reluctance to part with his wealth, left the visitors disheartened. His lack of compassion for those in need only served to further solidify his reputation as a miserly figure in the eyes of the community.

Despite the festive atmosphere that enveloped the city, Seth remained unmoved by the warmth and joy that surrounded him. As the night grew darker and colder, Seth retired to his lonely chambers, the echoes of the Christmas cheer reverberating outside his door.

Little did Seth know that the events of this Christmas Eve would set into motion a series of encounters that would challenge his beliefs and open his heart to the true spirit of the holiday season. The arrival of Marley's ghost would herald a night of revelations and redemption for the stern and solitary Seth Laxmidas.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. Seth Laxmidas, an Indian man known for his frugality, was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.

“Humbug!” said Seth; and walked across the room.

After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.

This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Seth then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.

The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.

“It’s humbug still!” said Seth. “I won’t believe it.”

His color changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.

Marley’s Ghost The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Seth observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Seth, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.

Seth had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.

No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.

“How now!” said Seth, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”

“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.

“Who are you?”

“Ask me who I was.”

“Who were you then?” said Seth, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.

“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”

“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Seth, looking doubtfully at him.

“I can.”

“Do it, then.”

Seth asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.

“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.

“I don’t,” said Seth.

“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”

“I don’t know,” said Seth.

“Why do you doubt your senses?”

“Because,” said Seth, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”

Seth was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.

To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Seth felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Seth could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapor from an oven.

“You see this toothpick?” said Seth, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.

“I do,” replied the Ghost.

“You are not looking at it,” said Seth.

“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”

“Well!” returned Seth, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! Humbug!”

At this, the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Seth held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!

Seth fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.

“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”

“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”

“I do,” said Seth. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”

“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”

Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.

“You are fettered,” said Seth, trembling. “Tell me why?”

“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will, I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”

Seth trembled more and more.

“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have labored on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”

Seth glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.

“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”

“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Seth, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”

It was a habit with Seth, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.

“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Seth observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.

“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.

“Seven years dead,” mused Seth. “And traveling all the time!”

“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”

“You travel fast?” said Seth.

“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.

“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Seth.

The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.

“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labor by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”

“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Seth, who now began to apply this to himself.

“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”

It held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.

“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”

Seth was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.

“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”

“I will,” said Seth. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”

“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”

It was not an agreeable idea. Seth shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow.

“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”

“You were always a good friend to me,” said Seth. “Thank’ee!”

“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”

Seth’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.

“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.

“It is.”

“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Seth.

“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls One.”

“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted Seth.

“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”

When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head, as before. Seth knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.

The apparition walked backward from him, and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.

It beckoned Seth to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Seth stopped.

Not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.

Seth followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.

The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Seth in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power forever.

Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together, and the night became as it had been when he walked home.

Seth closed the window and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.

STAVE TWO. THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS. When Seth awoke, it was so dark that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighboring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.

To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!

He touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped.

“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Seth, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”

The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Seth Laxmidas or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.

Seth went to bed again and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was, and the more he endeavored not to think, the more he thought.

Marley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”

Seth lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered on a sudden that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.

The quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.

“Ding, dong!”

“A quarter past,” said Seth, counting.

“Ding, dong!”

“Half-past!” said Seth.

“Ding, dong!”

“A quarter to it,” said Seth.

“Ding, dong!”

“The hour itself,” said Seth, triumphantly, “and nothing else!”

He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.

The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his

Seth Laxmidas, an Indian man known for his stinginess, sat alone in his dimly lit office on a cold Christmas Eve. The air was heavy with the scent of old papers and forgotten dreams, as memories of past joys and sorrows lingered in the room.

Suddenly, a mystical Spirit appeared before Seth, its presence gentle yet unmistakable. The Spirit's touch seemed to awaken forgotten emotions within Seth, stirring a mixture of thoughts and feelings long buried beneath his frugal exterior.

“What troubles your heart?” the Spirit inquired, noticing a tremor on Seth's lip and a tear on his cheek.

Seth, with a rare catch in his voice, dismissed the tears as nothing more than a pimple, eager to follow wherever the Ghost would lead him.

As they journeyed through the night, memories of Seth's past came flooding back. They passed familiar landmarks, and Seth recognized every gate and tree, until they reached a market-town bustling with holiday cheer. Laughter filled the air as children played and families prepared for Christmas.

“These are but shadows of the past,” said the Ghost. “They do not see us.”

As they continued their journey, Seth saw a vision of his younger self, a neglected child left behind by his friends. Overwhelmed with emotion, Seth wept at the sight of his own forgotten loneliness.

The Spirit guided Seth to a grand but decaying mansion, once filled with life and warmth. They entered a barren room where a lonely boy sat reading by a feeble fire. Seth's heart ached as he recognized his own neglected self in the boy, surrounded by the echoes of a past he had long abandoned.

The Spirit then showed Seth scenes from his past, bringing back memories of lost friends and missed opportunities. Despite his usual frugality, Seth found himself reminiscing with a mix of laughter and tears, his heart softening with each recollection.

As the night unfolded, the Spirit revealed more glimpses of Seth's past, including a poignant moment with a beloved sister who had brought him hope and joy in his darkest days. The memory of her unconditional love touched Seth's heart, reminding him of the true meaning of family and connection.

Through a series of visions, the Spirit showed Seth the impact of his choices on those around him, highlighting the power of kindness and generosity in changing lives for the better. Seth was confronted with the consequences of his own actions, leading him to reflect on the true value of wealth and the importance of human connection.

As the night drew to a close, the Spirit showed Seth a final vision of a lost love, a woman who had once held his heart before the allure of wealth consumed him. Confronted with the truth of his own greed and neglect, Seth realized the emptiness of his pursuit of riches at the cost of love and happiness.

Overwhelmed with regret and longing, Seth pleaded with the Spirit to show him no more, his heart heavy with the weight of his past mistakes. As the Ghost faded away, leaving Seth alone with his memories, a glimmer of hope sparked within him, igniting a desire for redemption and a chance to change his ways before it was too late.

In another scene and place, a room not very large but full of warmth and comfort, sat Seth Laxmidas, an Indian man known for his stereotypical stinginess. Near the winter fire was a beautiful young girl, resembling someone from Seth's past, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The room was filled with noise and joy - more children than Seth could count in his agitated state, each exuding energy beyond belief. Unlike a well-behaved group, every child was mischievously lively, causing uproarious consequences. The mother and daughter laughed heartily, enjoying the chaos as the young ones playfully pillaged and teased each other.

Seth watched with a mix of amusement and longing, yearning to join in the festive spirit despite his stingy nature. He imagined himself partaking in the playful antics, yet restrained by his reserved demeanor. The scene tugged at his heart, wishing he could interact freely with the children, especially the young girl with braided hair and a precious little shoe.

Suddenly, a knock at the door interrupted the lively scene, and a rush of excitement ensued as the family greeted the father returning home with Christmas toys and gifts. The room erupted into joyful chaos as the children eagerly explored the presents, their laughter echoing in the air.

As Seth observed the heartwarming family reunion, he couldn't help but feel a pang of regret for his own solitary existence. Seeing the love and connection between the family members made him reflect on the emptiness in his own life.

The story continued as Seth's perspective shifted, and he found himself in a strange and magical encounter with a Spirit of Christmas Present. The spirit led him through the bustling streets on Christmas morning, where people joyfully prepared for the holiday festivities. Seth witnessed the spirit's benevolent actions, blessing humble households and spreading goodwill among the community.

Throughout the journey, Seth learned valuable lessons about generosity and compassion, realizing the true spirit of Christmas lies in giving and sharing with others. By the end of his transformative experience, Seth's heart had softened, and he embraced the joy of the season with newfound warmth and kindness in his soul.

Seth Laxmidas was a successful businessman in Mumbai, known for his shrewdness and frugality. Despite his wealth, he was stingy to a fault, always looking for ways to cut costs and maximize profits. Seth had a reputation for being cold-hearted and indifferent to the struggles of others, earning him the nickname "The Miser of Mumbai."

One cold Christmas Eve, Seth Laxmidas sat alone in his lavish penthouse apartment, counting his money and grumbling about the holiday season. He scoffed at the idea of generosity and charity, believing that people only cared about themselves. As he settled in for the night, he was visited by the ghost of his former business partner, who warned him of the consequences of his selfish ways.

Throughout the night, Seth was visited by three more spirits who showed him glimpses of his past, present, and future. He saw how his greed had alienated him from his family and friends, leaving him alone and miserable. Witnessing the hardships faced by others due to his selfish actions, Seth began to question his own values and priorities.

As the dawn broke on Christmas morning, Seth Laxmidas woke up a changed man. Overwhelmed with remorse, he set out to make amends for his past behavior. He donated generously to charity, helped those in need, and opened his heart to those around him. The once-stingy businessman had transformed into a kind and compassionate individual, spreading joy and goodwill wherever he went.

Seth Laxmidas learned that true wealth came not from hoarding money, but from sharing it with others. And as he embraced the spirit of Christmas, he found a happiness and fulfillment that money could never buy. From that day on, Seth lived his life with generosity and kindness, proving that even the most miserly of hearts could be touched by the magic of the holiday season.

Seth Laxmidas, an Indian man known in his community for his extreme frugality, found himself in the midst of the Christmas season. He was a solitary figure, consumed by his penny-pinching ways and reluctance to share his wealth with others. Despite his reputation, he was about to embark on a remarkable journey that would challenge his beliefs and transform his perspective on life.

As Seth went about his usual routine of counting his savings and refusing to partake in any festive celebrations, he was visited by a series of spirits who aimed to show him the error of his miserly behavior. The first spirit, a jovial and lively figure, took Seth on a tour of a Christmas gathering where he witnessed the joy and camaraderie shared among friends and family. Despite his initial resistance, Seth couldn't help but feel a twinge of longing for the warmth and connection he saw in others.

The second spirit, a mysterious and foreboding figure, led Seth through the darker corners of society, where he encountered individuals struggling with poverty and hardship. Seth was confronted with the stark reality of his unwillingness to help those in need, and he was forced to confront the consequences of his selfish actions.

Finally, the third spirit, a solemn and haunting presence, showed Seth a future filled with regret and despair if he continued on his current path. He witnessed the consequences of his greed and the impact it had on those around him. Overwhelmed with guilt and remorse, Seth realized the importance of generosity and compassion in shaping a meaningful life.

By the end of his transformative journey, Seth had undergone a profound change of heart. He vowed to mend his ways, to open his heart and his purse strings to those in need, and to embrace the spirit of Christmas with newfound humility and kindness. As he woke from his visions, Seth knew that he had been given a second chance to rewrite his story and make a positive difference in the world around him.

The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Seth Laxmidas glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.

Seth Laxmidas glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Seth's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.

Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!

No voice pronounced these words in Seth's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!

He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Seth did not dare to think.

“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”

Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.

“I understand you,” Seth returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”

Again it seemed to look upon him.

“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Seth quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”

The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.

She was expecting someone, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.

At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.

He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.

“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.

“Bad,” he answered.

“We are quite ruined?”

“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”

“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”

“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”

She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.

“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”

“To whom will our debt be transferred?”

“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep tonight with light hearts, Caroline!”

Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.

“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said Seth; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be forever present to me.”

The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Seth looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.

Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!

“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”

Where had Seth heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?

The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.

“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.

The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!

“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”

“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”

They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:

“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”

“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”

“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.

“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”

She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”

Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.

“Sunday! You went today, then, Robert?” said his wife.

“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”

He broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.

He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of someone having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.

They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”

“Knew what, my dear?”

“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.

“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.

“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”

“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.

“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”

“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.

“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with someone, and setting up for himself.”

“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.

“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”

“Never, father!” cried they all.

“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”

“No, never, father!” they all cried again.

“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”

Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!

“Spectre,” said Seth, “something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?”

The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before—though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Seth to tarry for a moment.

“This court,” said Seth, “through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”

The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.

“The house is yonder,” Seth exclaimed. “Why do you point away?”

The inexorable finger underwent no change.

Seth hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.

He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.

A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!

The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.

“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Seth, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”

Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.

“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Seth. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!”

The Spirit was immovable as ever.

Seth crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Seth Laxmidas.




The Last of the Spirits
The Last of the Spirits


“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.

The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.

“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!”

The finger still was there.

“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”

For the first time the hand appeared to shake.

“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!”

The kind hand trembled.

“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!”

In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.

Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.


STAVE  FIVE.
THE END OF IT.
Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in!

“I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!” Seth repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. “The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!”

He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.

“They are not torn down,” cried Seth, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, “they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!”

His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.

“I don’t know what to do!” cried Seth, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”

He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.

“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried Seth, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”

Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!

“I don’t know what day of the month it is!” said Seth. “I don’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t know anything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. I’d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”

He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!

Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!

“What’s to-day!” cried Seth, calling downward to a boy

Seth Laxmidas, an Indian man known for his stereotypical stinginess, was the focus of this tale. He was a wealthy businessman who only cared about his profits and had no time for frivolous things like Christmas cheer.

One cold Christmas Eve, Seth was visited by the spirit of his late business partner, who warned him of the consequences of his greed and selfishness. Throughout the night, Seth was visited by three more spirits who showed him scenes from his past, present, and future, highlighting the impact of his actions on those around him.

As the night progressed, Seth began to see the error of his ways. He realized how his stinginess had alienated him from his family and friends, leaving him lonely and miserable. The spirits' visit sparked a change in Seth's heart, and he vowed to make amends for his past behavior.

The next morning, Seth woke up a changed man. He set out to spread joy and kindness to those around him, starting with his employee, Bob Cratchit. He raised Bob's salary and promised to help his struggling family. Seth also reached out to his estranged family members and friends, seeking reconciliation and forgiveness.

As the days passed, Seth's generosity and compassion knew no bounds. He became a beloved figure in the community, known for his acts of kindness and charity. He embraced the spirit of Christmas wholeheartedly, making up for lost time by celebrating the holiday with his loved ones.

In the end, Seth Laxmidas became a shining example of redemption and transformation. He learned the true meaning of Christmas and dedicated his life to spreading joy and goodwill to all. And as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!
