## Diverse Stories

Use GenAI to generate stories with diverse characters (based on classic out-of-copyright novels, stories, etc.).

The [script](diverse_stories.py) takes the name of the file with the story, gets the name of the protagonist, and the traits the character should have. The script creates a prompt, chunks the story, and then outputs a file with the rewritten story.
