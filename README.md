## Diverse Stories

Use GenAI to generate stories with diverse characters (based on classic out-of-copyright novels, stories, etc.).

The [script](diverse_stories.py) takes the name of the file with the story, gets the name of the protagonist, the traits of the character and cultural background. The script creates a prompt, chunks the story, and then outputs an adapted story.

* [Alice in Wonderland](./alice_in_wonderland.txt) with an [Indian lead, Nayna](./alice_in_wonderland.rewritten.txt)
* [A Christmas Carol](./christmas_carol.txt) with an [Indian seth Laxmidas](./christmas_carol.adapted.txt)
