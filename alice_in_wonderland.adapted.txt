CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole
Nayna, who loves to rhyme, loves the color blue, and has two braids, was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank of the Powai Lake in Mumbai, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the script her sister was reading, but it had no song-and-dance sequences or dialogues in it. "What's the use of a script without songs and drama?" thought Nayna. 

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and dull), whether the joy of creating a new Bollywood dance routine would be worth the effort of getting up and picking the lotus flowers by the lake, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes hopped past her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Nayna think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit murmur to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took out a pocket watch, and then hurried on, Nayna stood up in surprise, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a pocket watch, or a pocket to take it out of. Burning with curiosity, she ran after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it hop down a large rabbit-hole under a banyan tree.

In another moment, Nayna followed it down the rabbit-hole, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Nayna had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with colorful Bollywood posters and film reels; here and there she saw dance costumes and musical instruments. She took a poster from one of the walls as she passed; it was labelled "BOLLYWOOD MAGIC", but to her great disappointment it was torn: she did not want to damage it further, so she managed to carefully keep it aside as she fell past it.

"Well!" thought Nayna to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of performing in front of a huge audience! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I danced on top of the tallest building!" (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder how many songs I've sung by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be getting somewhere near the heart of Bollywood. Let me see: that would be four Bollywood blockbusters down, I think—" (for, you see, Nayna had watched several films of this sort in her time, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showcasing her knowledge, as there was no one to appreciate it, still it was good practice to hum the tunes) "—yes, that's about the right number—but then I wonder what iconic scenes or dialogues I've got to?" (Nayna had no idea what iconic scenes were, but thought they were nice grand moments to experience.)

Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall dance right through the earth! How enchanting it'll seem to come out among the people that dance with their hearts open! The Bollywood Stars, I think—" (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) "—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the city is, you know. Please, Sir, is this Mumbai or Delhi?" (and she tried to perform a graceful dance move as she spoke—imagine dancing as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what a clueless little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Nayna soon began singing again. "My friends will miss me very much today, I should think!" (Her friends were the street dogs.) "I hope they'll remember my plate of vada pav at snack-time. My dear friends! I wish you were down here with me! There are no street food vendors in the air, I'm afraid, but you might find some leftover samosas, and that's very close to vada pav, you know. But do dogs eat samosas, I wonder?" And here Nayna began to get rather sleepy, and went on singing to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do dogs eat samosas? Do dogs eat samosas?" and sometimes, "Do samosas eat dogs?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was dancing hand in hand with her friends, and saying to them very earnestly, "Now, my friends, tell me the truth: did you ever taste a samosa?" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of film reels and glittering costumes, and the fall was over.

Nayna was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, dancing down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Nayna like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my stars and stripes, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of colorful lights hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Nayna had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of sparkling glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Nayna's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Nayna opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a film reel: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the most enchanting film set you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and dance around among those sets of vibrant colors and lively music, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought poor Nayna, "it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could twirl like a Bollywood dancer! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Nayna had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a script for dazzling dance moves: this time she found a little bottle on it, ("which certainly was not here before," said Nayna,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME," beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Nayna was not going to do that in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked 'spicy' or not"; for she had heard several spicy Bollywood stories about people who had eaten spicy food and ended up in unexpected situations. However, this bottle was not marked "spicy," so Nayna ventured to taste it, and finding it very flavorful, (it had, in fact, a mix of chaat masala, coconut chutney, biryani, jalebi, and lassi,) she very soon finished it off.

In the bustling city of Mumbai, in the colorful and vibrant neighborhood of Dharavi, there lived a young girl named Nayna. Nayna loved to rhyme, adored the color blue, and always wore her hair in two long braids. She lived in a small, cramped chawl with her parents and siblings, struggling to make ends meet. Despite their poverty, Nayna found joy in the simple pleasures of life, especially in eating vada pav from the street vendors.

One hot afternoon, as Nayna was wandering through the narrow lanes of Dharavi, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight—a talking mouse, trembling in fear. The Mouse, known for its Bollywood references and dramatic flair, was in a frenzy, exclaiming, “Our family always despised street dogs—filthy, uncouth creatures! Don’t mention them again!”

Nayna, quick to change the subject, asked the Mouse about its fondness for street food. “Do you enjoy spicy misal pav or crispy bhel puri?” she inquired. The Mouse, intrigued by Nayna’s knowledge of local delicacies, decided to share its story with her.

As they conversed, they were joined by a motley crew of creatures from the neighborhood—a chatty Duck, a pompous Dodo, a colorful Lory, and a curious Eaglet. Together, they embarked on a peculiar adventure, navigating the chaotic streets of Dharavi in search of a solution to their damp predicament.

The Mouse, a respected figure in the community, proposed a unique way to dry off—a Caucus-race. The rules were simple: run as you please and stop when you feel dry. Amidst laughter and camaraderie, the eclectic group raced through the crowded lanes, their spirits lifted by the joy of the moment.

After the race, as they sat in a circle, the Mouse entertained them with tales of historical figures and local legends, much to the confusion of the other creatures. Nayna, always eager to learn, listened intently, trying to make sense of the Mouse’s convoluted narratives.

Impressed by Nayna’s patience and kindness, the creatures decided to bestow her with tokens of appreciation. Each offered a small gift—a piece of street art from the Duck, a vibrant feather from the Lory, and a heartfelt poem from the Eaglet.

As the day drew to a close, Nayna reflected on the strange yet magical experience she had shared with her newfound friends. Despite the challenges of her everyday life, she found solace in the bonds of friendship and the beauty of storytelling that transcended cultural barriers.

And so, in the bustling streets of Mumbai, Nayna’s tale echoed through the alleyways of Dharavi, a testament to the power of imagination, community, and the enduring spirit of a young girl who dared to dream in a city where magic lurked in the most unexpected places.

Nayna, who loves to rhyme, loves the color blue, and has two braids, lived in the bustling city of Mumbai in the 2010s. She was a poor girl with a heart as big as the Arabian Sea that bordered her city. Nayna's favorite snack was vada pav, which she would often enjoy from the street vendors outside her school.

One day, Nayna found herself shrinking after eating a magical vada pav. As she shrank, she ran out of her tiny house and stumbled upon a group of talking animals and birds outside. In the midst of them was a poor little lizard named Bill, being teased by two mischievous monkeys instead of guinea-pigs.

Startled by the chaotic scene, Nayna decided to venture into a dense Bollywood-style forest to find a way to grow back to her normal size. As she wandered through the woods, she came across a mystical garden that seemed to hold the key to her predicament.

In the garden, she encountered a majestic blue caterpillar, smoking a hookah and speaking in riddles. Nayna, intrigued by the caterpillar's cryptic advice, engaged in a conversation with it about identity and transformation. The caterpillar, instead of questioning her, offered her guidance on embracing change and self-discovery.

As Nayna continued her journey through the enchanted forest, she encountered a peculiar pigeon that mistook her for a serpent due to her elongated neck. Despite the pigeon's confusion, Nayna remained calm and tried to explain her true nature. The pigeon, after a moment of reflection, accepted Nayna for who she was and shared tales of its own struggles.

Nayna's adventures led her to a whimsical house where a chaotic scene unfolded with a Duchess, a cook, and a mischievous Cheshire cat. Amidst the chaos, Nayna learned valuable lessons about kindness, perseverance, and the importance of staying true to oneself in a world full of madness.

Through her encounters with eccentric characters and surreal situations, Nayna discovered that true growth comes from embracing one's uniqueness and facing challenges with courage and compassion. And as she bid farewell to the fantastical world she had journeyed through, Nayna carried with her the wisdom of Wonderland, forever changed by her extraordinary experiences.

In the bustling city of Mumbai, in the vibrant 2010s, lived Nayna, a young girl with two braids, a love for rhyming, and a fondness for the color blue. Nayna hailed from a poor family in the heart of the city, where the aroma of vada pav filled the air and Bollywood references were a part of daily conversations.

One day, Nayna found herself in a peculiar situation as she stumbled upon a mysterious door in a tree. Curiosity piqued, she opened the door and stepped into a whimsical garden filled with colorful flowers and enchanting fountains.

In this garden, Nayna encountered three gardeners frantically painting white roses red. Bewildered, she approached them to inquire about their unusual task. As she listened, the gardeners, named Five, Seven, and Two, bickered and bantered, each blaming the other for their mishaps.

Amidst the chaos, Nayna learned that the Queen of Hearts had a penchant for red roses and had ordered the gardeners to repaint the white ones. However, their comical misunderstandings and misadventures led to amusing consequences, with accusations of tulip-roots instead of onions and the looming threat of beheading.

As Nayna navigated through the whimsical garden and its eccentric inhabitants, she realized that sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunication can lead to humorous outcomes. She also learned the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and the value of clear communication in avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

With a mix of Bollywood flair, Mumbai's vibrant energy, and a touch of whimsy, Nayna's journey through the Queen's Croquet-Ground was a delightful blend of cultural references and timeless lessons, showcasing the universal themes of misunderstandings, accountability, and the power of effective communication.

Nayna, who loves to rhyme, loves the color blue, and has two braids, lived in the bustling city of Mumbai in the 2010s. She was a poor girl who adored eating vada pav, a popular street food in Mumbai. One day, as Nayna wandered through the crowded streets, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight: a group of gardeners frantically painting roses.

Seven, the head gardener, stopped his work and turned to Nayna, his brush still in hand. "Well, of all the unjust things—" he started before noticing Nayna standing nearby. The other gardeners also looked her way and bowed respectfully.

Curious, Nayna asked, "Why are you painting those roses?"

The gardeners hesitated, then Two spoke up, "The truth is, Miss, this was meant to be a red rosebush, but we mistakenly planted a white one. If the Queen discovers our error, we could lose our heads. So we are doing our best before her arrival." Just then, Five spotted something and cried out, "The Queen! The Queen!" The gardeners immediately prostrated themselves on the ground.

A grand procession approached, led by soldiers carrying clubs. The courtiers followed, adorned with diamonds, while the royal children skipped along, adorned with hearts. Among the guests were familiar faces like the White Rabbit and the Knave of Hearts. Finally, the King and Queen of Hearts arrived, completing the majestic parade.

As the procession passed by Nayna, the Queen demanded, "Who is this?" She turned to the Knave of Hearts for an answer.

"Idiot!" the Queen exclaimed, dismissing the Knave. Turning to Nayna, she inquired, "What's your name, child?"

"My name is Nayna, Your Majesty," she replied politely, though she couldn't help but think, "They are just a deck of cards, after all. No need to fear them."

The Queen, frustrated by Nayna's boldness, ordered, "Off with her head!" But Nayna, undeterred, protested loudly, "Nonsense!" Surprisingly, the Queen fell silent.

The King intervened, urging, "She is only a child, my dear."

Ignoring him, the Queen turned to the Knave and commanded, "Turn them over!" The Knave obeyed, carefully flipping the gardeners upright.

"Get up!" the Queen shrilled, and the gardeners promptly rose, bowing to the royals.

Annoyed, the Queen scolded, "Stop that! You make me dizzy." Turning to the rosebush, she demanded, "What have you been doing here?"

The gardeners, led by Two, explained their predicament. After inspecting the roses, the Queen declared, "Off with their heads!" The procession continued, leaving three soldiers behind to carry out the sentence. The terrified gardeners sought refuge with Nayna, who protected them by placing them inside a large flowerpot. The soldiers, unable to find their targets, eventually departed.

"Have their heads been removed?" the Queen bellowed.

"Their heads are gone, Your Majesty!" the soldiers reported.

"Excellent!" the Queen exclaimed. "Care to play croquet?"

The soldiers, unsure how to respond, turned to Nayna, who bravely accepted the invitation.

As they played, Nayna found herself in a bizarre croquet-ground, with live hedgehogs as balls, flamingos as mallets, and soldiers contorting themselves into arches. Amidst the chaos and constant bickering, the Queen's temper flared, leading to frequent cries of "Off with his head!" or "Off with her head!"

Growing uneasy, Nayna pondered her predicament. She realized the gravity of being in a realm where beheadings were a common occurrence. Seeking an escape, she noticed a familiar grin in the air—the Cheshire Cat.

Engaging the Cat in conversation, Nayna found solace in having someone to talk to amidst the madness. The Cat, known for its cryptic ways, shared insights on the irrationality of the Queen's court.

Despite the chaos, Nayna's courage and quick thinking caught the attention of the royals. As the Queen issued more orders for executions, Nayna's presence seemed to bring a sense of order amid the disorder.

Encountering the Duchess and the Mock Turtle, Nayna listened to their peculiar stories and philosophical musings, gaining a deeper understanding of the whimsical world she had stumbled into.

In this fantastical adventure through the streets of Mumbai, Nayna, with her love for rhymes, blue hues, and vada pav, navigated a topsy-turvy realm of cards, croquet, and eccentric characters, all while staying true to her courageous and compassionate nature.

In the bustling city of Mumbai, in the vibrant 2010s, lived Nayna, a young girl with two braids, a love for rhyming, a fondness for the color blue, and a passion for eating vada pav. One day, while wandering through the busy streets of the city, Nayna stumbled upon a mysterious rabbit hole that seemed to beckon her to explore its depths.

As Nayna descended into the hole, she found herself in a fantastical world filled with peculiar creatures and enchanting landscapes. Instead of meeting the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, she encountered characters straight out of Bollywood movies, such as the Chaiwallah Chameleon and the Sari-clad Serpent, who regaled her with tales of their adventures in the sea of dreams.

The Chaiwallah Chameleon, known for his wisdom and wit, teased Nayna for her simple question about their underwater school. The Sari-clad Serpent, with her melodious voice, shared stories of ancient mysteries and modern marvels, captivating Nayna with her tales of seaography and drawling.

Instead of lessons in arithmetic and uglyfication, Nayna learned the art of rhythm and the beauty of storytelling from the Bollywood characters she met along her journey. Each character had a unique talent to share, from dancing lobsters to singing turtles, adding a touch of Bollywood magic to Nayna's adventure.

As Nayna navigated this whimsical world, she discovered that the key to unlocking the mysteries of this wonderland lay in embracing her creativity and celebrating her cultural heritage. Through her encounters with the fantastical beings of this world, Nayna learned valuable lessons about the power of imagination, the importance of self-expression, and the beauty of diversity.

In the end, as Nayna stood before the King and Queen of Hearts in a courtroom filled with curious creatures and animated cards, she realized that the true essence of Wonderland lay not in its fantastical elements, but in the lessons it taught her about embracing who she was and celebrating the richness of her cultural identity.

And so, with a heart full of rhymes, a spirit painted blue, and a taste of vada pav lingering on her lips, Nayna emerged from Wonderland, forever changed by the magical journey that had taken her from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the enchanting realms of her imagination.

Nayna's Adventures in Mumbai

Nayna, who loves to rhyme, loves the color blue, and has two braids, lived in the bustling city of Mumbai. She was a poor girl who enjoyed eating vada pav from the local street vendors. One day, while wandering through the colorful streets of a Mumbai neighborhood, Nayna stumbled upon a mysterious rabbit hole.

As she peered curiously into the hole, she found herself tumbling down into a fantastical world filled with vibrant Bollywood references and quirky characters. Instead of the Mad Hatter, there was the Miserable Dancer who dropped her ghungroo bells and bangles, and went down on one knee to perform a dance.

“I’m a struggling artist, your Majesty,” she began.

“You're a very melodious dancer,” said the Queen.

Here one of the pigeons cheered and was immediately hushed by the attendants of the court. (As that is quite a tricky step, let me explain how it was done. They had a large tabla drum, which they used to create rhythmic beats: into this, they played the pigeon, head first, and then danced around it.)

“I'm glad I've seen that move,” thought Nayna. “I've often watched Bollywood movies where the dancers perform intricate choreography, but I never understood how they did it till now.”

“If that's all you know about it, you may sit down,” continued the Queen.

“I can't go any lower,” said the Dancer. “I'm already on the floor, as it is.”

“Then you may dance on,” the Queen replied.

Here the other pigeon cheered and was hushed.

“Come, that finished the pigeons!” thought Nayna. “Now we shall get on better.”

“I'd rather finish my dance,” said the Dancer, with an anxious look at the King, who was reading the list of actors.

“You may go,” said the Queen, and the Dancer hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put on her bells.

“—and just take her act outside,” the Queen added to one of the attendants. But the Dancer was out of sight before the attendant could reach the door.

“Call the next performer!” said the King.

The next performer was the Duchess’s chef. She carried the spice box in her hand, and Nayna guessed who it was, even before she entered the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

“Present your performance,” said the King.

“Won't,” said the chef.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty must appreciate this performance.”

“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melodramatic air, and, after striking a pose and frowning at the chef till her spices were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are the dishes made of?”

“Spices, mostly,” said the chef.

“Chutney,” said a sleepy voice behind her.

“Capture that Sleeping Mouse,” the Queen shouted. “Exile that Mouse! Remove that Mouse from the court! Silence him! Wake him up! Off with his whiskers!”

For some moments, the whole court was in chaos, getting the Mouse removed, and by the time they had settled down again, the chef had disappeared.

“Never mind!” said the King, with a sense of relief. “Call the next performer.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Truly, my dear, you must appreciate the next performer. It quite gives me a headache!”

Nayna watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next performer would be like. “—for they haven't got much talent yet,” she said to herself. Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill voice, the name “Nayna!”

CHAPTER XII.
Nayna’s Performance
“Here!” cried Nayna, quite forgetting in the excitement of the moment how many eyes were on her, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she bumped into the tabla set, upsetting all the musicians onto the heads of the audience below, and there they lay sprawled about, reminding her very much of a Bollywood dance sequence she had watched on TV.

“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began helping them up again as quickly as she could, for the scene of the musicians kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be back on their instruments at once or the performance would be ruined.

“The show cannot go on,” said the King in a very serious tone, “until all the musicians are back in their proper places—all of them,” he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Nayna as he said so.

Nayna looked at the musicians, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Drummer upside down, and the poor little thing was waving his sticks about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to play. She soon got him right again, and corrected the rest; “not that it matters much,” she said to herself, “I should think the performance would be just as good with the musicians one way up as the other.”

As soon as the musicians had recovered from the shock of being upset, and their instruments had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to create a new performance, all except the Drummer, who seemed too overwhelmed to do anything but sit with his sticks in hand, gazing up at the ceiling of the court.

“What do you know about this performance?” the King said to Nayna.

“Nothing,” said Nayna.

“Nothing at all?” persisted the King.

“Absolutely nothing,” said Nayna.

“That's very crucial,” the King said, turning to the audience. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbit interrupted: “Crucial, your Majesty means, of course,” he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces as he spoke.

“Crucial, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, “crucial—insignificant—insignificant—crucial—” as if he were trying which word sounded best.

Some of the audience wrote it down as “crucial,” and some as “insignificant.” Nayna could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.

At that moment, the King, who had been busy writing in his notebook, called out “Silence!” and read from his book, “Rule Forty-two. All performers more than a mile high to leave the court.”

Everybody looked at Nayna.

“I'm not a mile high,” said Nayna.

“You are,” said the King.

“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.

“Well, I won’t leave, at any rate,” said Nayna. “Besides, that's not a real rule: you made it up just now.”

“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.

“Then it should be Number One,” said Nayna.

The King turned pale and shut his notebook quickly. “Deliberate on your verdict,” he said to the audience, in a low, trembling voice.

“There's more to perform yet, please your Majesty,” said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a hurry; “this script has just been found.”

“What’s in it?” said the Queen.

“I haven't read it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a script, written by the performer to—someone.”

“It must be that,” said the King, “unless it was written to no one, which is unusual, you know.”

“To whom is it addressed?” said one of the audience members.

“It isn't addressed at all,” said the White Rabbit, “in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside.” He unfolded the script as he spoke and added, “It isn't a script after all; it's a set of verses.”

“Are they in the performer’s handwriting?” asked another audience member.

“No, they're not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that's the oddest thing about it.” (The audience all looked puzzled.)

“She must have imitated someone else’s style,” said the King. (The audience all brightened up again.)

“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”

“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse. You must have intended some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest person.”

There was a general applause at this; it was the first truly clever thing the King had said that day.

“That proves her guilt,” said the Queen.

“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Nayna. “Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!”

“Read them,” said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his glasses. “Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?” he asked.

“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:

“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”

“That’s the most critical piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the King, rubbing his hands, “so now let the audience—”

“If any one of them can explain it,” said Nayna, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) “I’ll give him a rupee. I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.”

The audience all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the script.

“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)

“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: “‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the audience, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be what he did with the dishes, you know—”

“But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you,’” said Nayna.

“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the dishes on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—‘before she had this fit—’ you never had fits, my dear, I think?” he said to the Queen.

“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing a spice container at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

“Then the words don’t suit you,” said the King, looking around the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

“It’s a wordplay!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let the audience consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

“No, no!” said the Queen. “Judgment first—verdict afterwards.”

“Nonsense!” said Nayna loudly. “The notion of having the judgment first!”

“Silence!” said the Queen, turning purple.

“I won’t!” said Nayna.

“Off with her performance!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.

“Who cares for you?” said Nayna, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re nothing but a deck of cards!”

At this, the entire deck rose up into the air and came flying down upon her: she gave a little cry, half of surprise and half of anger, and tried to fend them off, and found herself lying on the ground, with her head in the lap of her friend, who was gently brushing away some fallen flowers that had fluttered down from the trees onto her face.

“Wake up, Nayna dear!” said her friend; “Why, what a long nap you've had!”

“Oh, I've had such a peculiar dream!” said Nayna, and she told her friend, as well as she could remember them, all these fantastical Adventures of hers that you've just been reading about; and when she had finished, her friend kissed her and said, “It was an odd dream, dear, certainly: but now come in for your snack; it’s getting late.” So Nayna got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what an extraordinary dream it had been.

But her friend sat still just as Nayna left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Nayna and all her extraordinary Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—

First, she dreamed of little Nayna herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighboring pool—she could hear the clink of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the baby elephant was sneezing on the Duchess’s lap, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the roar of the Lion, the squeaking of the Monkey’s toy, and the barking of the suppressed puppies filled the air, mixed up with the distant cries of the miserable Street Dog.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Mumbai Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the clinking teacups would change to tinkling cowbells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the street vendor—and the sneeze of the baby elephant, the roar of the Lion, and all the other peculiar noises would change (she knew) to the confused clamor of the busy marketplace—while the mooing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Street Dog’s howls.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Mumbai Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find joy in all their simple joys, remembering her own childhood, and the happy monsoon days.
